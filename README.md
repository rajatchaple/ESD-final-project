# Remote Interfacing with 8051

The project aims to allow the user to flash and test their binaries on the flash memory of 8051. \ 
This is achieved by connecting the 8051 to a target microcontroller, MSP432P401R in this case and connect the user to the target controller via a Wi-Fi module, ESP32. \
The project also aims to design a PCB for the target system consisting of the MSP432 controller, ESP32 module, LCD module and the 8051 microcontroller. \
The project extends in providing the user with a utility to connect to network and to allow selection of hex files.
